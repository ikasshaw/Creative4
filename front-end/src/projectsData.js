      '       This project was to design and built a robot in a team of four to\n' +
      '        autonomously score ping pong balls into goals located in the corners of\n' +
      '        a four-foot square arena. This project required the use of a\n' +
      '        PIC24F16KA301 Microchip microcontroller to control the system and\n' +
      '        interface with various sensors and actuators. The robot used photodiodes\n' +
      '        and QRD sensors to orient itself within the arena and compressed air\n' +
      '        with a pneumatic solenoid to launch the ping pong balls into the goals\n' +
      '        from a predetermined location. Stepper motors were used for navigating\n' +
      '        to the dispensing area and the firing position. My primary\n' +
      '        responsibilities on the team were microcontroller programming and\n' +
      '        implementation of the pneumatic firing system.',

      '        This project was to design and build a prototype pipsqueak engine to run\n' +
      '        on compressed air in a team of four. Engine components were modeled\n' +
      '        using Solidworks. Engineering drawings for each component were produced\n' +
      '        then used to manufacture each part using various manual machining\n' +
      '        processes. Parts were required to be appropriately toleranced in the\n' +
      '        design phase and meet these tolerances after manufacture.',
